# Prework-study-guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: 

I am looking to expand my skills and I always wanted to get into web development, I tried few years ago but failed as I didn't understand anything at all but now  I am doing this bootcamp with a different mindset. This Project has helped me to understand, how you can link css and js file to your HTML and also what github is and how it works. 

I learnt a lot in this prework, it has helped me understand the basic fundimenals of the front-end web development.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.


## Installation

First download VS code, create a github and gitlab account. Then follow the pre work to complete the assignment, 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
